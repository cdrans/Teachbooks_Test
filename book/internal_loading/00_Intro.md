# Introduction
When we construct a Free Body Diagram of an engineering system and analyze the equilibrium state of that body, we are examining only the forces and moments acting on the isolated body. However, for engineering design, we eventually need to examine how loads are carried within a structure so we can evaluate if it will fail or not. Within this chapter, we will examine this process of evaluating internal loads and look at ways of visualizing internal loading distributions. In fact, you have technically already done this for one type of structure â€” a truss structure. We will build upon the internal force analysis you have already performed for truss structures and look at internal loading from a more general perspective.
